# sketchpad

This repository is for the Etch-A-Sketch project found on TheOdinProject.com.

The project is setup to use black as the default color and change the grid blocks in the container div once the mouse hovers over a given block.

There are still colors to choose from, plus an eraser (color: white), and a random button to generate a random color using HEX numbers.

The grid can be scaled as well to use smaller blocks, by clicking one of the designated Grid Size buttons.
